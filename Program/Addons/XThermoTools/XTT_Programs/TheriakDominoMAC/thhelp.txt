Format of file thhelp.txt (don't change the name of this file; it is hard-coded)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Significant lines in this file are only those enclosed in a block of the 
form 
  $BLOCKNAME
  ......... 
  .........
  $END

  $BLOCKNAME is the only argument passed to subroutine HelpMe from the 
calling program unit. For example 
         Call HelpMe('$DOM-SCRIPT')
To be valid, the block-delimiting strings $BLOCKNAME and $END should begin at 
position 1 of the line. Significant lines are shown on screen just as they are 
written here. For convenience of reading on screen, significant lines should 
not be longer than 80 chars. Screen paging of lengthy blocks can be achived 
by empty lines with character § at position 1. Such lines are not shown on 
screen, but cause subroutine HelpMe to stop listing the block and ask the user to 

'Hit any key to continue!' 

This file is help for all programs. For easy book-keeping, blocknames begin
with something identifying the program followed by a string from the context
of the help requested, see below.

    file name: If the input is not recognized as one of the keywords above,
               it is interpreted as the name of a drv-file. This file
               drives equilibria calculations, e. g., along a given PT-path. 
               It may contain the following directives:
§
    "REF" t1  p2         : defines the eqilibrium assemblage at the reference
                           t1, p2. This is the  "reference assemblage" adding
                           the variable "G_overstep" to the tab- and tcp-files. 


    "COMP"  formula  use : Defines the bulk composition for the calculations.
                           "formula" and "use" follow the same format as
                           in dat-files.
                           Example:
                          
                                COMP   SI(3)AL(1)MG(3)K(1)O(12)H(2)   *

    "ADD"  formula       : Adds the given formula to the current bulk com-
                           position. The amounts may be negative, but only so
                           much will be substracted that all components 
                           remain >= 0. Example:

                                ADD   H(20)O(10)

    "REMOVE"  phase  p   : After each of the following calculations, the com-
                           position of stable "phase" will be (partly) removed
                           from the bulk. "p" is the percentage of "phase" that
                           is to be removed. Example:

                                REMOVE  GARNET  100

     "TP"  t2  p2  s     : Calculates equilibria along a linear TP-path. T and
                           P change between the current values t1, p1 and t2, p2.
                           The current values t1, p1 are input 
                              1. either from the dat-file, 
                              2. or from a preceeding "TP" or "REF" directive  
                           within the drv-file. 
                          "s" is the number of calculation steps (default= 1) 
                           along the path. All variable values for each step are 
                           written into the tab- and tcp-files. Example: 

                                TP   800   5000   10
NOTE: 
A tab-file is a comma-delimited table of all variable values that are
calculated at every step. It can be read by most spreadsheet programs (e.g. 
"Excel"). A tcp-file is simmilar and can be used as input to program 
"TecPlot".

                          below.
                         
NOTE: Depending of your operating system, input might be case sensitive !
§

DOMINO-SCRIPTING
----------------

DOMINO can be instructed to calculate many different phase diagrams 
non-interactively, for example overnight. For each of these phase diagrams, 
the input normally needed by DOMINO, e.g. name of the database, definition 
of X and Y axis, calculation parameters etc., must be prepared and saved in 
a SCRIPT file (spt-file) beforehand. The names of script files may
be defined individually, or are generated by default as files named 
"scriptXX.spt", where XX is an integer between 01 and 99. Each of the script 
files substitutes for the keyboard, i.e. for your responses to questions 
that DOMINO normally asks you. So, you may let DOMINO do its job unattended 
without you being present and answering the questions. The script files 
may be executed by means of an executable BATCH JOB file. 

§

Structure of the executable batch files
---------------------------------------

By default, the name of this executable file is as follows.

   Unix/Linux/Mac : domjob  (might need setting the execute attribute before 
                             execution, e.g. "chmod u+x domjob")
   DOS-Win        : DomJob.bat

During execution, you have the possibility to give the batch job file a name 
of your choice. In this case, the SCRIPT files are accordingly named and 
numbered sequentially. For example, if you defined the name of the BATCH JOB 
file as

         myplot,
                     
the SCRIPT files to be created will be named as

         myplot01.spt, myplot02.spt, myplot03.spt etc. ...

The executable BATCH JOB file "myplot.bat" (DOS, Windows) or "myplot" (Unix 
and derivates) will contain then the following records:

        domino < myplot01.spt
        guzzler  myplot01.plt   myplot01.cln  myplot01.rxn
        explot   myplot01.cln   myplot01.ps
        domino < myplot02.spt
        guzzler  myplot02.plt   myplot02.cln  myplot02.rxn
        explot   myplot02.cln   myplot02.ps
        etc.

The first of these records calls DOMINO and instructs it that the information
it needs for calculation of phase diagram myplot01 is provided by script file 
"myplot01.spt". The graphics data will be written into a plt-file 
having the name myplot1.plt. This is given as input argument to gropram  
GUZZLER in the second line. GUZZLER will create appropriately named files 
that, again, are input arguments to program EXPLOT in the third line. The 
final result will be a PostScript file named myplot01.ps.

NOTE: BATCH JOB files may be edited carefully with any text editor!

§

Structure of SCRIPT files
-------------------------

Each script file contains records with the following information needed by
DOMINO. Text in parentheses are comments.

    script.myplot1.spt  (keyword "script." is diagnostic, don't change!)
    myplot1.plt     (graphics output file name)
    name of database
    calculation parameters
    1 to 6 lines of chemical information from file THERIN; 2-6 are mostly empty)
    definition of X-axis variable
    definition of Y-axis variable
    type of calculation
    choice of labels
    T and P if constant
    folder name for pixel map information

NOTE: SCRIPT files may be edited carefully with any text editor!

Here is an example of a SCRIPT file:
    script.script01.spt
    script01.plt
    jun92bs.txt
        1.0 350 0.01 0.1E-08 0.1E-06 0.1E+01 0.1E-04 25 15 100
    0   AL(2)SI(1)O(?)     *   this calculates the triple point

define the way reactions are labeled in the diagram. 

The input is:     "Label  (prec  smooth)"

Parameters in parentheses may be ommitted.
All input arguments must be delimited by at least two spaces.

"Label" can take the following values.
 
     "1"   For labeling reactions on each side with the stable assemblage, e.g. 
                  A B C = A B D
     "2"   For labeling reactions only by new phases produced, e.g. 
                  (C) = (D)
     "3"   For labeling reactions with a balanced equation, e.g. 
                  A + 2 B + C = 3 D
           If more than one reaction is involved, the coefficients are 
           ommitted, e.g. 
                  A B C = D

"prec"    is the precision in cm, (default=0.005). 
"smooth"  is the smoothness in cm, (default=0.04).

Help: running guzzler with command line arguments ($GUZ-CALL)
-------------------------------------------------------------

    GUZZLER can be called with as much as three command line arguments, i.e.

        guzzler  in-file  out-file  rxn-list

    where

        in-file:  Graphics file from DOMINO and TWEEQU
        out-file: Tided-up file
        rxn-list: list of reactions or assemblages

    If no command line arguments are passed, GUZZLER runs interactively
    and asks the user for the input file name, labels size etc. The  out-
    file and rxn-list are assigned their default file names defined in
    file "theriak.ini".

    If less than three command line arguments are passed, those files not 
    explicitly defined are assigned the default file names.

                      the list printed earlier on screen.

Labeling methods
----------------

The internal code for labels is:

     3: Full labels writen along line.
     2: Reaction number written in line
     1: Reaction number written offset, connected to curve with a fine line
     0: Line is not labeled
     
The default method is (3). If a label overlaps with others, method (2) is used. 
If labels still interfere, method (1) is applied, and finally if there is no 
room for a number near the line, it remains unlabeled.

Generally, a reaction line shorter than 0.02 cm (=minimum length) is not 
labeled.

$GUZ-GLOB
---------------------------------------------------------
Help: GUZZLER set global option for labeling ($GUZ-LABEL)
---------------------------------------------------------

The global option is used to simplify later editing of the plot with a 
PostScript editor. Generally, a reaction line shorter than the minimum length
(default = 0.02 cm) is not labeled.

The options are:
-3: (default) Write as much information as possible on the diagram.
 3: Force full labels on every curve. This may be useful, if few lines are
    present and the overlapping labels are to be moved manually with an editor.
-2: Use only numbers (no text-labels). The numbers may be either in the curve 
    or offset.
 2: Force the reaction numbers to be written in each curve.
-1: (force offset numbers, option not recommended)
 1: (use offset numbers only, option not recommended)

 0: Do not label curves. This option removes all labels and produces a clean
    diagram which can be labeled and colored manually.
 5: No offset numbers. This option produces a nice readable diagram.
    Short lines will not be labeled.
 4: Label all curves with either full text-labels or with numbers in line.

        The keys "alpha" and "beta" are pimarily defined having in  
        mind the volume function (corresponding to thermal expansion
        coefficient and isothermal compessibility coefficient, respec-
        tively). However, they may be used for any other function too.

NOTE: As usual, "key" must be separated from funtionNr by at least two blanks!

! The sructure of input data includes two parts: (a) External conditions for calculation (e.g. T and P) and
! (b) Bulk system composition given as element amounts.
! The first significant line should contain the external conditions as follows.
!
!   temperature(deg C)   pressure(bar)   optionally-[PGAS]-ratio 
!   where 
!           [PGAS]-ratio = (fluid pressure)/(total pressure)
!
! The second and further significant lines contain the bulk composition have the following form.
! 
!   print-code   bulk-formula    use-code   optional_comment
!  
!   where 
!       print-code should start at position 1 and may take the following values. 
!       < -1:   print information about selected or rejected phases from the database. 
!               NO EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATED. 
!       =-1:    print composition, considered phases and solution models. 
!               NO EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATED. 
!       = 0:    short output (stable assemblage) 
!       = 1:    long output (composition, considered phases, solution models, stable 
!               assemblage, activities of all phases 
!
!       bulk-formula is the element bulk composition written as follows.
!       ELEMENT1(Amount1)ELEMENT2(Amount2).....
!           A ? for the oxygen amount instructs the program to assign exactly 
!           the stoiciometric oxygene atoms to the other elements.
!
!       use-code controlls which phases are read from the database. Usually this is "*" 
!       for all phases matching the chemical system defined by bulk-formula.

!
!   For the most typical case, only one chemical input line is needed. The following lines are
!       ignored. For calculation of binary or ternary diagrams however, two or three additionalchemical
!       input lines are needed that define the the system«s endmember compositions.

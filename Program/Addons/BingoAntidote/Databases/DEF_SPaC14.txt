! These definitions are compatible with the versions of Spearâ€™s database SPaC14 
!
! Recommendations (July 2019):
!    - 	Pures phases should be included but Qcmp = 100 % if properly analysed
!    - 	Solid solutions should have all elements involved in the substitutions
!      	except Fe in minerals having high Fe-content and XFe3+ such as STAU
!	 - 	Spaces in solution model names in Theriak-Domino are replaced by 
!		underscores (e.g. WHITE MICA becomes WHITE_MICA)

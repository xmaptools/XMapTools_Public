<p>This help file contains a description of the <i>Calibration Assistant for EPMA Data</i>, which can be used to generate compositional maps from intensity data using spot analyses as internal standards. The general procedure is described in <a href="#Biblio">De Andrade et al. (2005)</a> and an advanced approach including pseudo-background correction is described in <a href="#Biblio">Lanari et al. (2019)</a>.</p> 

<p>The new approach implemented in XMapTools 4 provides a module for automatic multi-phase calibration. Please note that this is still a preliminary version of the calibration assistant. We expect significant progress in the coming years as the algorithm is trained to face the most difficult situations. In the meantime, please contact Pierre Lanari (pierre.lanari@unibe.ch) if your case is not well handled by the algorithm.</p> 


<h2><a name="Strategy"></a>Strategy advantages and pitfalls</h2>

<p>An automatic calibration is performed taking into account all spot analyses and all masks when the <i>Calibrate</i> button is pressed. The new algorithm first performs a general fit including all standards and then adjusts the calibration for each mineral. All calibration curves, including those for the general fit, are accessible from the tree menu.</p>

<p>When you press the <i>Apply Standardisation</i> button, all the calibrated maps for each mineral as well as a merged map are created and sent back to XMapTools. It seems magic, but it is not, first <u>make sure you check the quality of the calibration curves generated by the auto function</u>.</p>

<p>The automatic function will work if all minerals have been measured with at least a few spot analyses and if there is at least one mineral with a composition above 1 wt% for each element. If a mineral or other feature (e.g. fracture) has no spot analyses, the program extrapolates a calibration from the general fit and thus "predicts" a composition. At this stage <u>this composition is likely to be off because matrix effects are ignored!</u></p>

<p>If you close the Calibration Assistant window, no calibrated data or calibration settings will be saved. </p>

<p>When you press <i>Apply Standardisation</i>, all maps are sent to XMapTools. </p>

<p>The <i>Calibration Assistant for EPMA Data</i> opens when the <i>Calibrate</i> button in XMapTools is pressed.</p>

</center>

<h3><a name="DisplayCalib"></a>Displaying calibration curves</h3>

<p>Use the tree menu on the left to navigate through the list of minerals and elements and to view calibration curves. </p>

<p>When you select a mineral from the tree menu (Figure 1). A single plot showing the sum of elements/oxides (total wt%) is displayed. The plot in the middle shows all calibration curves, for all elements of the selected mineral. Some data is displayed in a table. </p>

<ul>
<li><b>El.</b> shows the element name (of the map), and the following labels: the sum of the median mineral composition considering all pixels (sum(wt%)) and the sum of the peak position (Peak(SumOx)).</li>
<li><b>#(std)</b> indicates the number of internal standards (spot analyses) used to calibrate this phase (e.g. 42 spot analyses for amphibole in Figure 2). Some elements may have a lower number of internal standards due to outlier rejection.</li>
<li><b>med(it)</b> shows the median intensity value for all pixels of the selected mineral for each element</li>
<li><b>med(wt)_s</b> shows the median composition of all internal standard measurements (spot analyses) </li>
<li><b>mode(wt)_m</b> shows the most common composition in the calibrated pixels. Note that the values of mode(SumOx) and Sum(wt) may be different, in which case the median is likely to be influenced by non-Gaussian signals and may not be comparable with the median of the spot analyses. However, the comparison of both columns can be used to detect potential calibration problems, which can be corrected using the manual adjustment (see below).</li>
<li><b>k factor</b> quantifies the difference between the calibration obtained during the general fit and the final calibration of the selected mineral. A value of 1 means that they are identical.</li>
<li><b>Slope</b> of the calibration curve of each element.</li>
<li><b>Background</b> value for each element corresponding to the intercept of the calibration curve.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>Figure 2</b>: Example of calibration when a mineral is selected. All calibration curves for a given mineral are displayed. </i></p>
</center>

<br />
<p>To view a specific calibration curve (for a particular element), expand the menu by clicking on the small arrow to the left of the mineral name and select an element. The corresponding calibration curve is displayed together with the corresponding quantitative map (oxide wt-%) (Figure 3).</p>

<p><i><b>Figure 3</b>: Example of the 'Calibration Assitant For EPMA Data' window when an element of a given mineral phase is selected. When an element is selected, the 'Fit (Manual)' button appears in the top left hand corner. The calibration curve and quantitative map for a given element will then be displayed.</i></p>
</center>


<h3><a name="AdjustCalib"></a>Adjusting a calibration curve</h3>

<p>When an element is selected, the <i>Adjust</i> <img src="./img/SS_Calibration_EPMA_Adjust.png" height="30"> button appears above the tree menu. </p>

<p>Clicking this button displays two fields containing the values for background and slope:</p> 

<img src="./img/SS_Calibration_EPMA_slopeandbackground.png" height="30">.

<p>Values can be changed manually by tapping new values in the appropriate field. </p> 

<p>Press Enter to calculate and display the new calibration curve on the graph (this operation may take a few seconds).



<h3><a name="DisplayCalibGeneralFit"></a>Displaying results of the general fit</h3>

<p>Selecting <i>General Fit</i> (last option in the tree menu, Figure 3) will display a plot of the calibration curves for all elements. </p>

<p>It is not possible to adjust the calibration curves in the general fit. This fit is automatically performed first by the program and is no longer used once the calibration of each mineral has been achieved.




<h2><a name="ApplyCalib"></a>Apply calibration</h2>

<p>After checking each calibration curve and adjusting if necessary, use the <i>Apply Standardisation</i> button <img src="./img/SS_Calibration_EPMA_Apply.png" height="30"> to generate the calibrated maps. </p>

<p>By applying the standardisation, the <i>Quanti</i> option in the <i>Primary Menu</i> becomes available. Here the quantitative maps in element/oxide wt-% of each phase can be displayed. </p>

<p>The <i>Merged</i> option in the <i>Primary Menu</i> also becomes available after standardisation. A set of merged maps (i.e. quantitative maps in oxide wt-% for all phases considered together) is automatically generated. </p>


<h2><a name="Notes"></a>Notes</h2>

<p>Red dots indicate outliers that were not included in the calculation of the calibration curves.</p>

<p>Moving the cursor over the images brings up a <i>Image Menu</i> at the top right. This menu includes options to zoom, save and copy the images. </p>

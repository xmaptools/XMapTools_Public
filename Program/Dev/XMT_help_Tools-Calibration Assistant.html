<p>This file contains a description of the tools available in the window <i>Calibration Tool</i>.</p> 


<h2>1 Main menu (on the left)</h2>

<h3>1.1 Options <i>Minerals' phases</i></h3>

<p>Select the mineral phase in the right menu. The correpondent map (what map is this one??) is displayed in the bottom right. The graphic in the central part exhibts the calibration curves for all the elements, whose parameters are available in the table below.</p> 
<p>To display the calibration curve of each element, click on the arrow on the left side of the phases' name opening a dropdown menu with the elements' list.  </p>
<p>By selecting an element, its calibration curve is displayed as well as the correspondent quantitative map (oxide wt-%).</p> 
<p>When an element is selected the button <i>Adjust</i> appears above the main menu. <p>

<h4>1.1.1 Button <i>Adjust</i></h4>
<p>By clicking on this button the values filled in the fields <i>Slope</i> and <i>Background</i> can be adjusted, by tapping the new values. </p> 
<p>Press enter to visualize the alterations on the graphic.</p> 

<h3>1.2 Option <i>General fit</i></h3>
<p>By selecting the <i>General fit</i> on the menu positioned on the left, a graphic with the calibration curves for all the elements are displayed. </p>
<p>Note: The red spots are not considered in the calculation of the calibration curves'.</p>

<h2>Button <i>Apply standardization</i></h2>
<p>Click on this button to calibrate the map. </p>
<p>Note: No adjustment on the calibrations' curves in the general fit is possible. The calibration is authomatically generated by the program. </p>
<p>XMapTools 4 employs a novel calibration method. More details about this calibration are given in XMapToolsâ€™ publication Lanari et al. (in prep.????)</p>

<p>By applying the standardization, the option <i>Quanti</i> in the main menu becomes available. There the quantitative maps in oxide wt-% of each phase can be displayed. </p>
<p>The option <i>Merged</i> in the main menu also becomes available after the standardization. The quantified merged maps (i.e., quantitative maps in oxide wt-% for all the phases together) are available for each oxide. </p>

<p>Note: By hoving the cursor on the images an <i>image menu</i> will appear on the upper right. This menu includes options to zoom, save and copy the images. </p>

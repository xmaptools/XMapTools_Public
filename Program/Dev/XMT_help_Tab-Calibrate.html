<p>This file contains a description of the tools available in the main tab <i>Calibrate</i>.</p> 
<p>The following steps are required to convert X-ray semi-quantitative maps and trace elements maps into fully quantitative maps of chemical composition. </p> 

<h2>1. EPMA Standard Data </h2>

<p>The standards constitute WDS spot analyses to be used as internal standards that will define the calibration curve that correlates X-ray intensity and oxide wt-% composition. </p> 
<p>Use those tools to import the standard file, add extra standards, apply stardards' position corrections and check the chemical composition of each spot analyses into XMapTools.</p>

<h3>1.1 Button <i>Import (Import spots for Standards (from file))</i></h3>
<p>Select the standards from the file 'standards.txt' if the box immediately below <i>Import from Standards.txt</i> is selected (default).</p>
<p>If the file has a different name, unselect the box and select the file in the <i>Pick a file</i> pop-up window. </p>
<p>The spot standards will be loaded in the displayer and each spot can be selected in the Secondary Menu <i>Standards(Spots)</i> on the left bar. </p>

<h3>1.2 Button <i>Std Mod (Open Standard Data Viewer)</i></h3>
<p>To activate this button, the function <i>Standards (Spots)</i> must be selected in the Secondary Menu (on the left). </p>  
<p> With this function it is possible to see a table with the composition (intensity and oxide-wt%) of each standard, check the quality and adjust the standards/maps positions and add new individual standards (together with the button <i>Add standard point</i> described below. </p>  
<p>By clicking on this button the right side of the window is activated. </p>  

<h4>1.2.1 Tab <i>Data</i> </h4>
<p>Use this option to visualize the element's composition of the standards in X-ray intensity in the 'Int' column and the correspondent oxide composition (wt%) in the column 'wt%'. </p>
<p>A standard must be selected in the function <i>Standards (Spots)</i> in the main menu (on the left).</p>

<h4>1.2.2 Tab <i>Plot</i> </h4>
<p> Functions available in this tab allows the user to check the quality and correct the position of the standards. </p>
<p> To change the displayed element, close the window <i>Data Standard Viewer</i>, select another element on <i>Intensity</i> and click again in the button <i>Std Mod</i> to reopen the window.  </p>

<h5>1.2.2.1 Plot <i>intensity and the composition (wt%) versus standards' positions</i> </h5>
<p> The graphic in the upper part of the window displays the compositions of the internal standard in wt% (red, right Y axis) and their respective intensities of the corresponding pixels (blue, left Y axis) for the spot analysis' position. </p>


<h5>1.2.2.2 Boxes <i>Check quality of standards/maps positions</i></h5>
<p>This function automatically searches the optimal positions of the spot analyses (internal standard) on the maps.  </p>
<p>In the box on top, a correlation between the compositions of the spot analyses (in oxide wt-%) and the compositions of the corresponding pixels (in counts) is calculated and the optimal position for this correlation is show in the center, in yellow.</p>
<p>The bottom box displays the optimal position (higher number) for all the elements are calculated as the sum of square of correlation coefficients of each element. </p>
<p>The blue circle represents the current correlation. If it is not positioned in the optimal position (yellow in the colorbar positioned on the right) it means there might have been some displacement between the maps and the spot analyses. </p>
<p>To adjust the position of the standards, hover the cursor over the blue circle showing up a transparent circle. Click on it and move the blue circle to the new position. The values in the two white field on top will be adjusted. Then click on the button <i>Refresh</i> to update the position in the graphic and in the boxes.</p> 

<p>Note: To activate the <i>Refresh</i> button,  the option <i>Standards (Spots)</i> in the main menu (on the left) must be selected.</p>
<p>Note: If no good correlation exists, the higher value of the second figure could not be the optimal position. In this case a problem should have occurred with the transformation of the map coordinates or the best position can be out of range.</p>


<h3>1.3 Button <i>Add standard point</i></h3>
<p> To activate this function, the button <i>Std Mod</i> (on the left) must be selected. </p>
<p> Then, by pressing the button <i>Add Standard Point</i>, a cursor is activated.</p>
<p> The new standard will be added by right clicking in the selected position. </p>
<p> It is posible to adjust the position of the new standard by moving the blue spot (transparent circle) or its label (cross-shaped cursor).</p> 
<p> Select the new standards on the Secondary Menu <i>Standards(Calibration)</i> on the left bar and the correpondent informtion table will become available in the <i>Data</i> tab located in the <i>Standard Data Viewer</i> on the right side of the window.</p>  
<p> Add the correspondent oxide (wt%) for the new standard in the column 'wt%' in blue. The correspondent X-ray intensity is already available in 'Int' column.</p> 
<p> ???? To save the new data, press the exit button 'X' on the top right to close the window. </p> 
<p> To rename the spot, select and left click on its name located in the <i>Standards(Spots)</i> on the Secondary Menu. </p> 


<h2>2. Standardization </h2>
<p>A calibration is required to convert X-ray semi-quantitative maps into fully quantitative maps of chemical composition. </p> 
<p>To activate this button, a mask file must be selected in the function <i>Mask File</i> on the Secondary Menu (on the left). </p>
<h3>2.1 Button <i>Calibrate (Open EPMA Wizard Calibration Tool)</i></h3>
<p> By clicking on this button the <i>Calibration Tool</i> window pops up. </p>
Note: XMapTools 4 employs a novel calibration method. More details about this calibration are given in XMapToolsâ€™ publication Lanari et al. (in prep.????)</p>

<h2>3. Local Bulk Composition Extractor </h2>
<p>As discussed in Lanari and Engi (2017), it is necessary to apply a density correction prior exporting any local bulk composition.</p>
